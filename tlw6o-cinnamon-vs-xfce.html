                            <p>This video is unavailable. Watch Queue Queue. Watch Queue Queue Queue. I have most recently used Linux Mint 17.3 with Cinnamon, and I like that DE a lot. I am going to install Debian Jessie and upgrade to Testing but I need to decide on a desktop. If I stick with Cinnamon will my experience be as nice as with Mint? I wonder whether certain DE's are better integrated in one distro compared with the next. The other DE I am considering is XFCE and I'd like Debian users' opinions on how these compare. I know I can install They have also looked at battery usage between Gnome, KDE, LXDE and XFCE. Since Cinnamon's Muffin is a fork of Mutter - you should perhaps assume the performance and resource usage will be similar or the same i.e. you could argue there is a direct read-across for the Gnome results to Cinnamon. As the title suggests, is cinnamon better for Linux Mint of is xfce better for Linux. xfce is extremely stable, KDE is now quite stable as well. your RAM is enough for both (my KDE setup uses 900MB after boot) Try both on live-boot and chose the one you like best  I can’t get used to XFCE except on my netbook (running manjaro netbook edition) - for regular notebook or desktop use I always prefer. 
Thinking about installing Linux Mint on my Dell XPS 15 laptop with a high resolution (3840 x 2160) screen. Do all of them have screen scaling? (I usually do 200%) Also, if I have UEFI secure boot and Bitlocker enabled for Windows 10. Will that present any issues when trying to install Linux for dual booting? Anyone have a guide they recommend. Fedora 24: Comparing Gnome, KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce, LXDE. With the final release of Fedora 24 arriving on Tuesday, I've installed each of the six desktops on a different laptop or netbook. I have an old HP Stream that I want to put Linux on. It has Windows and is so insanely slow I want to toss it through a window. I'm leaning toward Mate on it. I have Cinnamon on my new machine and I think it would be too taxing for the old HP. Is my thinking correct Robolinux Cinnamon, Mate, Xfce, LXDE & Gnome Videos & Screen Shots Announcing Two Upgraded Robolinux 9.5 Versions Announcing the brand NEW Robolinux Raptor Gnome  Enfrentamos a los cuatros escritorios que se ofrecen por defecto en Linux Mint: KDE, MATE, XFCE, y Cinnamon. El propósito de esta comparativa es ayudar a los principiantes a decidir qué escritorio usar, teniendo en cuenta requisitos de hardware, aspecto visual, características generales y facilidad I'm really digging Cinnamon and want to mess around with a second DE. I understand some people say they like MATE better than Cinnamon because it's more configurable. But if you go to the /r/unixporn survey results (https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/39h9gz/runixporn_survey_results/), you can see that XFCE is the second-most popular DE/WM (https://i.imgur.com/H90lUt2.png) right after i3. You can see some of the results are ridiculously sexy ( People. Linux Mint Cinnamon vs MATE. Cinnamon and MATE are the two most popular “flavors” of Linux Mint. Cinnamon is based on the GNOME 3 desktop environment, and MATE is based on GNOME 2. The desktop environments are best compared by actually using them, or, alternatively, you can check out some screenshots. 
My first ever experience with KDE (After having used Mint Cinnamon, Ubuntu Gnome, and Debian XFCE for a bit each) was a bit jarring. The amount of included software, for a lack of better words to come to mind, seemed bloated. And it wasn't just the amount. I saw Microsoft software, aka the skype and office suite, and immediately shut down the VM. After learning about Neon, i decided to do a comparison. 1.4 Gb iso vs almost 2.1. So this had me thinking i should just try to install Linux can be customized to a great extent. It offers a desktop environment for every user. GNOME, Unity, KDE, MATE DE’s are suitable for the users who are using Linux for everyday tasks such as web-browsing, listening to music, watching videos, etc. XFCE, LXQT don’t offer fancy animations and icons but they’re popular among developers. amp#x200B; Edit: As an update to everyone I have installed Manjaro XFCE - I hear that KDE is great (looking) but I also keep hearing that for some it has been buggy and for all it's at least a little less performant. I prefer performance given my task isn't to stare at the desktop or taskbar (: and it likes nice regardless. Performs excellently, VSCode is available at the most updated version in the built-in package manager (community provided albeit) and everything went smoooooth as butter. Can anyone think of any reason why I would be seeing lower CPU temps (8-10C) using Cinnamon when compared to XFCE? This is running the same applications (Chromium, Pidgin, Terminal, Thunderbird) and CPU usage is roughly equivalent (around 3-4% when idle). So I've been curious about linux for a long time and finally decided to start to make an effort to play around with and learn it by installing it on an old laptop I haven't used in years. I just went ahead and installed Ubuntu, and while it's not bad, I've always heard linux can make old machines fast again and that wasn't really the case for me. So, after a bit of Googling, I discovered Ubuntu isn't the most resource friendly for old machines, so I started doing a bit of research on different. As a result, both Mate and Xfce can be classified as traditional desktops. They consist of a desktop display, a panel and a launcher, and both are largely free of 3-D effects, the influence of mobile devices or any effort to innovate in any major design elements. 
I'm using Cinnamon and sometimes it's kind of freeze for a while. So I intend to switch to XFCE because I heard that it's lighter. But then I went to Mint websites and I saw the size of XFCE ISO file is just the same as Cinnamon. I googled for a review and I read this: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-lean-linux-desktop-environment-lxde-vs-xfce-vs-mate/ (https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-lean-linux-desktop-environment-lxde-vs-xfce-vs-mate/) This guy's tested showed that XFCE isn't lighter. Around 6 months ago, I made the move to Linux. I am not a gamer, so it was easy for me. To make the experience more authentic, I installed linux on my main machine and didn't dual boot Windows. It was only linux for me. It has been an interesting journey, but sorry I can't take it anymore. Please note that I am strictly speaking as a non-developer, non-geek but a "power user". My reasons might not apply for developers and very technical users. Below are the reasons am going back: 1) Windows. Before you downvote this, please read the whole post and decide for yourself. Lately I've seen a lot of people here saying "If Linux had more games, I would immediately switch", and "Linux needs to support more software". The fact that people use these arguments is kind of ironic. --- gt If Linux had more games, I would immediately switch  This is the exact reason why console players don't switch to PC. They will miss their exclusives. According to a lot of you it's worth losing those. I installed Ubuntu on my laptop, and then I installed my DE of choice, Cinnamon. The reasons I use Cinnamon are: I like how the panel and menu work better than the Ubuntu dock and panel (especially how the Cinnamon panel behaves more like the one in old-school Windows XP) I like the alt-tab functionality over how Ubuntu Gnome or Unity does it (switches windows rather than applications, similar to Windows) I can make workspace switching wrap around itself, unlike in Gnome--I mapped Super+T. ##### Ubuntu vs Kubuntu vs Xubuntu vs Lubuntu vs Ubuntu GNOME vs Ubuntu MATE vs Mint Cinnamon vs KDE neon vs Budgie RAM consumption ## TL;DR: Top 3 lightweight\ distros: (system, Firefox, file manager and terminal emulator launched) 1. Lubuntu (406MB) 2. Xubuntu (481MB) 3. KDE neon (528MB) / Ubuntu MATE (534MB) --- Lots of people are wondering which distro should they choose for the lowest possible RAM consumption: some of them are running on old low RAM computers. 
In order to select a distro, you need to know how distros differ, and which of those differences appeal to you and your use case. So, what are the major differences between distros? Release/update schedule. Release schedule is the major difference between distros, and it affects three very important considerations: software age/up-to-date-ness, new hardware support, and system stability. The more frequent the package updates, the faster the distro will get new software and support. 40+ Linux Distro Reviews from June 2016: Organized alphabetically by distro name and then from (roughly) more positive to more negative in review conclusions. Reviews require at least some opinions (I've tried to exclude articles with just screenshots, video walk throughs, or simply sharing release information) Please comment if I've missed any information or additional reviews published in June 2016. I've tried to be thorough, but this post is just me trying to give a little Long time ubuntu user and im thinking about trying a new distro for my new PC build. I like ubuntu, have been using it for about 8 years or so but have noticed how bloated it's gotten since the old days. I've been looking between mint, lubuntu, and xubuntu, but can't really tell the difference in some aspects. Mint: Ubuntu derivative with cinnamon but also delayed updates due to being based on ubuntu LTS lubuntu: Ubuntu but with LXDE for older hardware to keep up with and Xubuntu: Ubuntu. 
I hope this kind of post is not against the subreddit rules, if so just dont upvote :P, but I just had to tell somebody. I was an avid Gnome2 user and was using Ubuntu since 7.04. I knew about KDE and had used it a while back while making first contact with Linux when I was younger, but it I remembered it as not very good, especially the look wasn to my liking. So I was happy with Gnome2, than Unity happend . I survived one release cycle with fallback mode, but that wasn good enough Hey everyone, I installed Arch on a computer recently and am loving it. The freedom is great! I've been trying out various DEs, recently using Cinnamon but now trying XFCE. In Cinnamon, I had used the Faience icon themes (specifically Faience-Ocre), and of course the Faenza icon theme for dependency. The Cinnamon panel's icons seemed to theme properly and I was pleased with their look, but in XFCE the panel seems to use different icons even though I'm using the exact same theme. The icons. Hope it's ok to just ask questions here? (I'm a reddit noob). Occasionally friends who'd like to try Linux out ask me which distro is a good choice to start with and this used to be pretty easy; I'd go with Ubuntu or Mint depending on what they wanted (basically 'new experience' vs. 'drop-in windows replacement to just get stuff done in'). I find it hard to recommend Mint any more, Cinnamon is ugly (I know it can be themed, I really mean a more substantial ugliness of design which permeates. Made this throwaway to ask for help from /r/suggestalaptop on finding a contemporary convertible tablet pc. I've been using pen-based tablets for almost a decade to do my job, which requires high-speed note taking with a digitizer and stylus. My workflow is based around xournal and any nix that can run it. Previous tablets have included a Toshiba M200 (convertible, ancient tablet with non-PAE celeron), and a Fujitsu ST5112 (slate tablet PC with core 2 duo, no attached keyboard, tough When trolling through sites and vids looking for information on various linux distros I found most gt85% of them to be utter rubbish. The tube vids are most often just here is what is in the menu point and click. Seriously how about some actual information! Like what are the 3 unique things about this distro? What are the 3 things you like about it? What are 3 things you dislike? Perhaps some actual information like - - Samba is not set up and ready to go (most XFCE distros)l
