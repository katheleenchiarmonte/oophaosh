So I have Zemana Antivirus as my antivirus, today I was forced to install Faceit anticheat and now Zemana is not working. I tried restarting computer and didn't work. I then proceeded to uninstall Faceit AC and it started working immediately. What can I do? EDIT: Actually called Zemana AntiMalware. EDIT2: I should probably add that the Anticheat prevents the Antimalware from running even if the anticheat How do I install Zemana AntiMalware on my PC? Here is how: 1.

So, a few days ago I started getting popup malware in the Chrome browser (up to date version) on my office PC. I did not install anything new recently and usually do not visit any risky websites from there (if you do not consider reddit risky). The popups opened new tabs in Chrome, sometimes even when the browser was closed, it opened automatically. It was mostly the usual scam sites like "you won an iPhone" etc. The browser had few extensions installed (uBlock Origin, Poper Blocker for Chrome. Zemana AntiMalware is a recent addition to the array of on demand and online malware scanners. This means that it does not actually provides Real-Time protection, but rather scans when the users requests the program I'm not much of a "pirate", but I tend to download a thing or two every now and then. I try to make sure whoever uploaded it was legit and only download from pages that have comments in them. A while ago I used thepiratebay.wf (https://thepiratebay.wf) for a bunch of episodes of a show I watch and I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary around my computer. I decided to check out Reddit and found out there's some drama going on about it, especially when it comes to malware. amp#x200B;. I’m not ready to discard Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (free) just yet but I’ll definitely be keeping Zemana AntiMalware (free) on hand, no matter what. IMPORTANT UPDATE It’s just been pointed out to me by one of our readers that the latest free version (2.60) of Zemana AntiMalware no longer includes a Deep scan option, only Smart. I'm getting ads across multiple websites - all the ads point to the same site (www.justgetlook.com). This behavior is consistent across Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox. I've run MalwareBytes, HitMan Pro, and Zemana Anti Malware and they all say my system is clean. Adblock Plus makes no difference. I am not seeing any unusual ads on my smartphone. I don't have a second computer to try and determine if the ads are somehow being injected by my router. I am running a legal copy of Windows. 
Description. Zemana AntiMalware Free is a formidable “on-demand” malware scanner. Though this malware scanner does not offer real-time protection, it is still capable of identifying and removing nasty code that threatens the functionality of your computer. As it says on the tin - I've been dealing with a worm on my laptop (HP Omen line, can give further information if needed) for about three days now. I was attempting to watch a video online using the regular website I do, but it was refusing to load at all even upon page refresh, and occasionally while browsing the web normally pages refuse to load at all. Speeds sit around 40/20 when good, and dip under 1/1 when things go bad. As far as I remember, I hadn't done anything outside the ordinary. How does Zemana AntiMalware work on 64 bit system? How can I solve an disabling real-time protection or update issue? How do I install Zemana AntiMalware on my PC? Can I use AntiMalware on my mac OS? Is silent installation possible with Zemana AntiMalware? Why clicking the "X" closes Zemana AntiMalware Somehow, I've gotten myself a browser redirect hijacker that I can't figure out how to get rid of. Anyone know anything about this stuff that can help? I'm being redirected to Bing when I try to use Google. It's annoying, slows me down, and more importantly: that's all I'm aware of it doing. I've already deleted all my browser extensions and all programs from my PC from the last couple weeks (long before I noticed this bug) and even reinstalled my browser. I also used Avast, Malwarebytes As the title says, I can't seem to get rid of ursorsee.pro pop ups. I've went through the official malware removal guide steps, and in addition to this, I've also tried using Zemana AntiMalware and nothing has worked. Thanks in advance Yes, I know it says "Apps" in the title. Yes, I do understand that some of you think Apps is exclusive to stuff sold in an "Appstore". Apps is short for applications, and applications are programs. Get over it. If you're looking for appstore apps, try this thread! Has a bunch of good stuff. (https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3f8ysl/what_are_the_best_windows_10_apps_on_the_store/?ref=search_posts) The thread you're looking at now is mostly about apps from outside the Appstore. The symptoms are that my computer will periodically freeze up (I still see things update such as live notifications, video feed, or new messages) but everything is unclickable and unresponsive. The hover animations don't appear and no clicks will register. I originally thought this was only when I let my computer idle for a few minutes or more but it happens pretty much any time now (although less common when I'm using it). This will last until I do ctrl + alt + del and click once. It'll seemin. 
Operating System ================== Windows 10 64bit Computer Specs (PSU, GPU, CPU, RAM, Motherboard) ================== ASUS X751SA Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU N3700 @ 1.60GHz (4 CPUs), ~1.6GHz 8GB RAM Intel HD Graphics Speccy Link ================== N/A Description of problem ================== Windows PowerShell randomly appears in my task manager and eats up tons of CPU in the process, 60-70% of my CPU is being used, and it's appearing so often that it's a real hindrance. If I close. EDIT: PLEASE TRY ZEMANA ANTI VIRUS, IT HAS WORKED FOR ALMOST EVERYONE HERE. Operating System ================== Windows 7 Speccy Link ================== Description of problem ================== This virus has hijacked my search engine settings and I cannot set any other search engine as my default. Usually in the chrome settings on search engines when you click the 3 dot option menu it has a "Set this as my default" setting Sometimes the CMD opens and does this: https://i.imgur.com/zunr4nh.png it's not like in every hour, it's not scheduled, it's just randomly, sometimes after 2 or 3 hours, but most of the times when i turn my pc on. I have windows 10, and the problem comes from a russian virused torrent, which also came with random russian website opens, but after i ran my antimalware program (Zemana AntiMalware) everything disappeared but the CMD problem persists. Please help ! I don't really want to reinstal. Solved! It seems like 2 issues were causing this, 1. I had to go into the Chrome settings and disable synchronization for both extensions and apps, and 2. The Chrome shortcut seems to have been malicious, but out of 5 malware removal tools only Zemana Anti Malware (I don't know how legit or good it is but it was recommended for this issue) was able to find said shortcut, somehow AdwCleaner missed it. ------------------------------------------ TL:DR; After launching Chrome it readds. 
I tried malewarebytes, spybot, hitman pro, and some other software, but it seems that I am not able to get rid of a piec of nasty adware. whenever I start my browser (firefox) some shady start page appears. It does not even slow my pc down, everything works fine, but it sucks anyway. What else should I try? edit: got rid of it with Zemana AntiMalware, thanks to everybody. Edit2:No,still fucked Edit:I deleted a bunch of shady shit in my D drive aaaaaaand bam no trojans Everytime i turn on windows 10 malwarebytes detects and quarintines Trojan.BitcoinMiner That it found in C/windows/System32/diskdriver.exe.I deleted it in the quarantine tab,but it the problem came back instantly after restarting windows. I have tried: Running Rkill and Running scan in malwarebytes,avast,Zemana AntiMalware. This doesn't really matter but sidebar says so: system specs Ryzen To solve this annoying problem: 1. I deleted all browsing data since the beginning of time 2. I launched AdwCleaner and deleted all the files that this application found. 3. I reinstalled the browser. 4. I did quick scan with COMODO and after a hour it found two files. I cleaned these two files. 5. I am currently full scanning my computer using COMODO Internet Security Premium (scan not finished yet) All actions 1, 2, 3 and 4 failed and this annoying issue still persists. I hope that action. Hi guys, my laptop went in for some pretty minor repairs last week on the mousepad, and when I got it back it not only seemed a bit slower (probably my imagination), there seems to be some malware on the computer that means every https site tries to run a script which launches some dodgy websites, and my adblock was no longer working completely, there were a few dodgy looking "You won't believe what happened!" type ads that it had missed. Another issue with it is that clicking anywhere on websi. So I recently downloaded a torrent (FL Studio) from Pirate Bay (something I do not do often). The torrent that I downloaded had many downloads, many “seeders”, and even some comments from users saying that the download was safe, essentially all the things one would look for when trying to ensure a safe download. However when I downloaded it, BAM, got malware on my computer. Nothing too extreme, my computer slowed down a little bit and I had some Adware that was causing pop ups in my browser. 
I swear I've been working at removing this thing for hours and after running no less that 3 anti-malware programs (Malwarebytes, Zemana Anti-Malware, and combofix, though the last one didn't work for my system) I still find echoes of its existence on my computer. Most of it seems to be gone, but is there a program I can use to be 100% sure it's all gone? Note I have next to no experience at this stuff and am solely relying on information I looked up just after seeing the bad stuff on my compute. Whenever I open my browser, I get some kind of shady starting page. I already tried the malware removal guide on this sub, and I tried some other, different programs. So, I really do not know what to do next. It would be kind, if someon could help me. specs: windows 10, msi z100 mobo, i5-6600k, gtx 1060. 16gb of ddr4 ram, browser: firefox thanks for your time edit: got rid of it with Zemana AntiMalware. thanks to everybodey. </p>
